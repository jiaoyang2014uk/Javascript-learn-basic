	<p>In our ignorance, we begin to imagine ourselves as wiser than nature, or we think we can tweak it this way and tat to prove one thing or prevent another. We start dabbling where we needn’t. We decide we don’t like this expression and prefer another instead. We begin to impose rules and ways of being on ourselves and others. We believe it convenient for us all to behave the same and so discount diversity and opt for generic forms of human expression.

Expressions of nature begin to be suppressed and consequently distorted. Integrity and balance are disrupted. Natural integration begins to dis-integrate and health issues, whether physical, emotional, mental or spiritual, become the rule rather than the exception. The quality of life deteriorates and we wonder who is to blame.</p>
	<p>We live best when we allow– when we allow what IS to BE. We allow things to be as they are. We get out of our heads and our big ideas and we let nature teach us through our feelings. It is our feelings we need to listen to, not our big ideas and circles of thoughts. Feelings need to be paramount. Our hearts are our real guides. Deep in our hearts, the one life eternal lives, independent of expression and binding us all.

We achieve balance in relationship by acknowledging each other as equals and respecting the natural diversity in our expressions as individuals. We discover as we go, heeding the needs of each moment, and paying attention to how we feel and the relative balance in each situation. This is how we live.</p>

<P>The question “what is life?” may seem an absurd one, as it is somewhat obvious, given how deep one wishes to go. We might simply respond with “this is life”, “this, what you are living” and this answer would be an honest one. We could simply leave it at that and return to our day-to-day activities.

It is likely that, in asking the question “what is life?”, we are looking to dig a little deeper into “this” to find out more about what life is. Why dig deeper? Perhaps we wish to compare notes with others. Perhaps we want to iron out some details on what this actually is that we are doing by living.</P>
<P>Life is good because it has no choice to be otherwise. Life is good because given the choice between good and feeling bad, it consistently chooses to feel good, and because life must feel its way as it expresses itself in nature, depends on this feeling to know it is doing the right thing. Let’s take an example that we could all relate to:

You are visiting the Grand Canyon. You are approaching the edge in an effort to see all that you can and yet you approach it slowly and carefully, determined not to lose your balance as it is your nature to know when it feels out of such balance (or rather unsafe). Balance is our way of knowing in our hearts what is going to work and what will not.</P>
<P>As a child, building with blocks, we learn how to balance them, one on another, each level becoming stable before we move on to the next. This balancing act is part of natural law. Each level of life, from the subatomic particle up each kingdom and species, must answer to this need for a stable form of expression before another level of complication takes place.

Witness us as human beings with such complicated biological systems allowing human nature to live as an organized expression of life for seventy to eighty years— or more. Life does this. Life expresses the human for as a natural act. It is not our doing.

When we lose our balance, we feel it. We feel it in our health. We feel it in our relationships. Life is inherently and otherwise good because this is what life IS. The expression of energy in any balanced form is necessary for life to BE. So, life is good, and goodness is what life requires to keep living and living in a healthy manner. So, how to live? How to know you whether you are in balance?</P>
